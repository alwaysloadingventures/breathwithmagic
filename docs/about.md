# breathwithmagic — About the App

## Overview

breathwithmagic is a creator-first wellness platform inspired by the _relationship-driven monetization_ of OnlyFans and the _practice-focused content quality_ of DoYogaWithMe.

The core idea is simple:

breathwithmagic allows wellness creators (breathwork facilitators, yoga teachers, meditation guides, somatic practitioners, and coaches) to create personal profiles, publish free and paid content, and monetize direct relationships with their audience through subscriptions and one-off purchases.

Users subscribe to individual creators to unlock exclusive wellness content, guided practices, programs, and community access — all in one centralized platform.

breathwithmagic is **human-to-human wellness**, not studios, not gyms, not enterprise scheduling software.

## What breathwithmagic Is

breathwithmagic is:

- A **marketplace for individual wellness creators**
- A **subscription platform** for ongoing personal practice
- A **relationship-based content platform**, not a one-time course library
- A **direct monetization tool** for instructors and facilitators
- A **home for free + premium wellness content**

The emotional positioning is:

> “OnlyFans-style subscriptions, but for breath, wellness, and inner work.”

---

## What breathwithmagic Is NOT

breathwithmagic is **not**:

- A scheduling or booking tool like Mindbody
- A class aggregator like ClassPass
- A one-off course marketplace
- A corporate wellness platform
- A social media feed optimized for virality

Creators own their audience, pricing, and voice.  
breathwithmagic provides the infrastructure, discovery, and monetization rails.

Not algorithmic feeds, virality, or engagement manipulation.

When making product decisions, prioritize:

> “Does this help creators earn more, with less effort, while keeping the experience human, calming, and intentional?”

If the answer is no, the feature is likely out of scope.

- Calm
- Clean
- Human
- Minimalist
- Trust-forward
- Not corporate

Visual inspiration:

## Final Note

breathwithmagic is about presence.
About breath.
About shared practice.

It is not a feed.
It is not a tool.
It is a place.

Human to human.
Practice to practice.
